This version is based on https://github.com/santaclose/ImGuiColorTextEdit which is a fork of https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit.

The original version hasn't been updated in many years and as a result, there are a lot of forks. The santaclose fork was the most promising but it is going through active development and backwards compatibility and stability are sometimes an issue. This is why we keep a private version here to protect ourselves and keep things going.

A reusable version of this is maintained at https://github.com/goossens/ImGuiColorTextEdit. Down the line, we need to evaluate if we want to move back to a stable fork somewhere or switched permanently to our own version.
