ObjectTalk uses a lot of Open Source products without which it would have
been a lot harder to implement the project.

## Documentation

A another special thanks goes to the team that wrote the [Swift](https://swift.org) computer language
[documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/). It is awesome and I've respectfully reused a lot of it to document ObjectTalk.
