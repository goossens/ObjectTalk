The diagram below depicts the subsystems included in the ObjectTalk ecosystem.
As mentioned above, the four boxes on the right are available on both ObjectTalk
configurations whereas the five boxes on the left are only available when the
host operating system offers GUI libraries.

**Operating System Foundation**

ObjectTalk currently runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows. In general, the main development
platform is MacOS and typically the latest version is used.
For Linux, Ubuntu 22.04 is used and on Billy boxes, Window 11. The Github continuous
integration tasks also use the latest versions of these operating systems. For those
that use other Linux distributions, it is likely that ObjectTalk will compile out-of-the-box,
but this is not verified.

The entire ObjectTalk ecosystem is written in C++17 which is the most recent version that
is best supported on all platforms. Once C++20 finds better support, we will switch to it.

To simplify the ObjectTalk code baseline, the C++ standard library is used to the maximum
extend possible. Basic I/O function, filesystem access, containers and memory management
are simply used as is. Compiler developers typically do a good job optimizing things on each platform.

I know there are lot of people out there that believe they can do better than the standard library
(and they might be right) but the time required to optimize on multiple platforms is not worth it.
I’m old enough to have written operating systems in assembler and had to maintain C libraries
for even the most simple memory management or data structures. These days, I gladly take free
cross platform solutions and sacrifice a few CPU cycles (I have more of those than braincells).

To prove that I'm a hypocrite, the one exception to the rule is shared pointers. The version
included in the standard library is thread safe and therefore slow. Given that ObjectTalk always
runs in a single thread, a replacement shared pointer class is included that is not thread safe but
makes ObjectTalk twice as fast. Off course I argue that I would have used the standard library
if it only had included a fast non-thread safe smart pointer.

**ObjectTalk Language Engine**

The language engine uses some simple components to implement ObjectTalk. A lexical scanner turns
source code into tokens, the compiler translates these tokens to bytecode for a platform-independent
imaginary CPU, an optimizer turns simple code sequences into super instructions and the stack-based
virtual machine executes this bytecode.

**Core Classes**

Given that ObjectTalk’s virtual machine only understands a stack of opaque objects, there members,
member functions and basic branching, even the most fundamental operations like additions,
string manipulation and I/O must be implemented in ObjectTalk classes. The core classes subsystem
provides fundamental classes for primitives (booleans, integers, reals, strings and functions),
collections (arrays, dictionaries and sets) as well as a set of operating system, filesystem and
stream classes.

**Asynchronous I/O**

When implementing servers or I/O heavy applications, you typically have two options. Firstly,
you can go multithreaded and use many threads and thread pools to handle I/O request.
This approach however has proven not to be too scaleable and most web servers today don’t use it
or have complicated strategies to deal with performance and bottlenecks. The other approach is
to use a single thread with an event loop that runs as fast as possible and simply responds to
operating system events whenever they happen. ObjectTalk uses this last approach based on the
[Libuv](http://docs.libuv.org/) library that offers asynchronous operations as a cross-platform
solutions. Libuv was originally developed for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and is still in use
there. This means that it is well tested and maintained.

**HTTP Server**

ObjectTalk provides a number of classes that make it easy to implement a web server on top of
the Async I/O library. For those familiar with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the
[Express package](https://expressjs.com), you will recognize the similarities. If you need an
operational asynchronous web server, use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you want to use a
simple server using a few lines of code, this ObjectTalk library might be the ticket.

**Graphics Framework**

As mentioned above, the graphics framework is optional and will only be compiled in when the
host operating system provided the required GUI libraries. The foundation of this framework
is provided by a number of open source cross-platform libraries. [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
is used as an system independent abstraction for windows and user/system interactions.
[BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) is used as a system independent abstraction to render
graphics supporting Metal, OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX APIs. [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
is used as a neutral user interface library and all widgets are implemented with it.
The framework glues all of this together and ObjectTalk users will never have to deal with this level of detail.

In the original design for the graphics framework, the ObjectTalk language was used to construct all
the components for a user interface. Unfortunately, this led to very verbose code and it would take
pages of code to create all the things you would need for a user interface, 2D board or 3D scene.
In fact, the ratio between construction code and functionality was so bad that a new approach was implemented.

Today, the framework uses an Entity Component System (ECS) as an architectural pattern to represent
user interfaces, 2D (game) boards and 3D (game) scenes. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
which is explained later, provides editors to manipulates ECS objects. By doing this, the ObjectTalk
language is no longer used to construct visual objects but it is used for runtime logic and interaction.
For those old enough to remember the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, the model is expressed
in the ECS, the view is provided internally by the ObjectTalk ecosystem and the controller is written in ObjectTalk.

**GUI Widgets**

ObjectTalk has a rich set of platform independent widgets that can be used to create user interfaces and apps.

**2D Boards**

ObjectTalk has a rich set of 2D components that can be used to create 2D billboards or board games.

**3D Scenes**

ObjectTalk has a rich set of 3D components that can be used to create pretty 3D environments or games.
Modern graphics techniques like Physically Based rendering (PBR), deferred and forward rendering,
High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines, Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO), and post-processing filter
like bloom, depth-of-field, lens flare, gamma correction and brightness are all available.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**

To top it all off, ObjectTalk comes with its own IDE to edit ObjectTalk scripts, GUIs, boards and scenes.
The IDE runs in a single window (with tabs) and has full undo/redo/cut/copy/paste capabilities
for all content types. From the IDE, script, GUIs, boards and scenes can be validated and run.
Errors are highlighted inline making it easy and fast to finish a project.
