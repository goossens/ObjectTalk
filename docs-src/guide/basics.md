ObjectTalk is an object-oriented scripting language that was developed
from the ground up to be efficient and pure. Nonetheless, many parts of
ObjectTalk will be familiar if you have experience with developing in C
and derived languages.

ObjectTalk provides its own versions of fundamental C types, including
Boolean, Integer (for int), Real (for double), String for textual data
and Function as first class primitives. ObjectTalk also provides powerful
versions of the three primary collection types: Array, Dictionary and Set.
In fact, in ObjectTalk everything is an object derived from a class and
the word type is only used internally in the language's runtime. Primitives
like Booleans, Integers, Reals, Strings and Functions are objects just like
Arrays, Dicts, Sets and HTTP servers.

**Variables**

Variables associate a name (e.g. myVariable) with an object derived from
a certain class (e.g. the number 10 or the string "Hello"). Variables
in ObjectTalk must be declared to establish visibility in a certain
scope. In the following example (let's assume this is at the top level
of a module), the value 10 will be assigned to variable myVariable in the
module's scope.

	var myVariable = 10;
	print(myVariable); // this will print the number 10.

In the following example, the variable is assigned to a class
and therefore becomes a class member.

	class myClass: Object {
		var myVariable = 10;
	}

	print(myClass.myVariable); // this will print the number 10.

As you can see from the examples, variables do not have to be type
declared as the assignment determines what type of object is stored
in the variable.

**Comments**

In ObjectTalk, you can use comments to include non-executable text in
your code or as a note or reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by
the ObjectTalk compiler when your code is compiled. ObjectTalk allows
three types of comments: multiline C-style comments, single line
C++ style comments and single line shell-style comments.

Multiline C-style comments start with a forward-slash followed by an
asterisk:

	/* This is also a comment
       written over multiple lines. */

Single-line C++ style comments begin with two forward-slashes:

	// This is a comment.

Single-line shell-style comments begin with a number sign:

	# This is a comment.

A shell style comment allows ObjectTalk scripts to be made executable
in UNIX type systems. The following first line (typically called a
"shebang") tells the UNIX shell to execute this script with the ObjectTalk
interpreter.

	#!/usr/bin/ot

**Semicolons**

Unlike some newer languages, ObjectTalk mandates the use of Semicolons
at the end of statements that don't end with a block. This allows
statements to be written over multiple lines (without the need for
backslashes) and it avoids possible ambiguity. For example, earlier
versions of ObjectTalk allowed:

	a = 10
	++b

To most people, it is obvious that we want to assign the number 10 to
variable a and pre-increment variable b. The compiler however doesn't known
the first statement ended after the number 10 and it will generate code
for:

	a = 10++;
	b;

To avoid this confusion, semicolons are mandatory at the end of statements
that don't end with a block so the ObjectTalk script should have read:

	a = 10;
	++b;

**Null**

Null is a special value that indicates a valueless state. All instances
of the Object class are null values. The default global scope defines the
variable **null** as a convenience.

	var nothing = null;
	var alsoNothing = Object();

**Booleans**

[Booleans](classes.html#boolean) in ObjectTalk can only hold two
logical values: true and false. The default global scope defines the
variables **true** and **false** as a convenience. A large number of
language operators or member functions return Booleans as a result.

	var bool1 = true;
	var bool2 = false;
	var bool3 = !bool2;

**Integers**

[Integers](classes.html#integer) are signed whole numbers with no
fractional component, such as 42, +1 and -23. On most systems, this number
is implemented as a 64-bit number meaning that the extremes are
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive).

Integer literals can be written as:

* A decimal number, with no prefix
* A binary number, with a 0b or 0B prefix
* An octal number, with a 0o or 0O prefix
* A hexadecimal number, with a 0x or 0X prefix

All the following integer literals have a decimal value of 17:

	var decimalInteger = 17;
	var binaryInteger = 0b10001;       // 17 in binary notation
	var octalInteger = 0o21;           // 17 in octal notation
	var hexadecimalInteger = 0x11;     // 17 in hexadecimal notation

**Reals**

[Reals](classes.html#real) are signed floating point numbers with a
fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15. Reals are
implemented using 8 bytes and have a range of 1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits).

Real literals can be written as a floating point number with or without an exponent:

	var decimalDouble = 12.1875;
	var exponentDouble = -1.21875e1;

The default global language context pre-defines the variable **pi**
(3.14...) and **e** (2.71...) as a convenience.

**Strings**

[Strings](classes.html#string) are a series of characters, such as
"hello, world" or "albatross".
ObjectTalk strings are instances of the String class. Strings are
made up of unicode characters encoded in UTF-8. Given that UTF-8 uses
variable length encoding, ObjectTalk does not measure or index strings
in bytes but rather in codewords that represent a character whether it is
1,2, 3 or 4 bytes long.

String literals are encoded using the same logic as JSON making it
easy to exchange information with other languages or systems. A string
literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (").

	var someString = "Some string literal value";
	var message = "\tMost Europeans like the \u00C4.\n";

Multiline strings can also be created:

	var quotation = "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
		'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked.

		'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely,
		'and go on till you come to the end; then stop.'";

**Functions**

[Functions](classes.html#function)  are self-contained chunks of code
that perform a specific task. You give a function a name that identifies
what it does, and this name is used to “call” the function to perform its
task when needed. See the [Functions section](#functions) below for
more details.

	function test1(callback) {
		callback();
	}

	var test2 = function() {
		print("Hello, world!");
	};

	test1(test2);
