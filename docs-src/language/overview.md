Below is a formal expression of the ObjectTalk scripting language in
Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF). You can read more about this
notation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form). The pretty diagrams were created using
the ["RailRoad Diagram Generator"](https://github.com/GuntherRademacher/rr)
which translates EBNF into HTML with pictures. This tool is highly
recommended for visualizing grammar.
