Late 2020, I retired after a 40+ year career in the software and
system development business. Starting as a programmer/analyst and later
moving up the ladder to management, international standardization
and geopolitics, I was exposed to lots of technologies including operating
system design, computer language development, military command and control
systems, web application design, data science and what we now call
artificial intelligence. You can read my full bio on
[my website](https://goossens.github.io).

After retirement, I dusted off some old projects to improve mental
health (applying the "use it or loss it" principle like we do for physical
health) and that's how this repository came about. I started by revisiting
a scripting language I wrote decades ago, modernizing it and learning
things along the way. Once the language was stable, it needed a few
use cases and I dusted off some 2D/3D graphic projects that I had laying
around. This then led to including a graphics engine, an Entity Component
System (ECS), Node Based programming and a custom Integrated Development
Environment (IDE).

So today, this project contains a lot of code, compiles into a single
executable with no runtime dependencies and is functional on MacOS, Linux
and Windows. It basically is a playground to learn and have fun.
Think of it as a educational jack of all trades, master of none.
