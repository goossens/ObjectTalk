ObjectTalk contains a pretty decent 2D/3D graphics engine that works
across multiple platforms providing system agnostic abstractions
for the higher level capabilities. At its core, the graphics engine
manages graphical resources (e.g. shaders, buffers, uniforms, textures
and other assets) and is multithreaded. It also contains cross platform
libraries to implement canvases, filters, generators, vector displays,
font management, asynchronous asset loading in a variety of formats,
2D/3D geometric primitives, manifold definitions and 2D path manipulation.

Some of its capabilities are already exposed to the scripting language
and the examples folder shows how to use it to create simple GUIs,
run some games in a vintage vector display or implement a simple
version of Pac-Man.
