To round it all out, the ObjectTalk executable comes with a builtin
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows editing and
execution of the ObjectTalk elements:

- **ObjectTalk script editor**
	- This editor provides a powerful syntax highlighting capability modeled after a subset of Visual Studio Code.
	- The editor has full undo capabilities and works with UTF-8 encoded text.
	- The editor can launch ObjectTalk scripts and has a console for output and highlighting for errors.
	- A visual debugger is also available.

- **Node editor**
	- This editor allows the visual creation of node graphs.
	- The editor has full undo capabilities.
	- The editor automatically evaluates graphs so it can be used for realtime visual programming (e.g. image processing or asset generation).

- **Scene editor**
	- This editor allows the creation and configuration of entities and components.
	- Entities are stored in trees making it easy to create entity hierarchies.
	- The editor has full undo capabilities.
	- Scenes can be run directly from the IDE to ensures node and script components function properly.

- **Miscellaneous editors**
	- The IDE is also capable of editing pure text, JSON and Markdown files (complete with syntax highlighting).
