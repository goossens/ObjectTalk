ObjectTalk is a simple object-oriented scripting language that has
evolved over decades and was heavily influenced by other languages.
As a long time IT professional, I've seen a lot of software development
with all its greatness and flaws. ObjectTalk represents what I think
is a well-balanced scripting language that is easy to learn and can make
even a novice look good quickly. If you are interested in how I got
to where we are today, please see the [history](tour.html#history)
page for the story behind ObjectTalk.
