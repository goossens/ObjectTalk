              Below is a set of tutorials that explore the 3D part of the
              Graphical User Interface (GUI) module. These tutorials assume you
              are already a little familiar with the ObjectTalk language and
              have read the <a href="tour.html">tour</a> and
              <a href="guide.html">guide</a> parts of the documentation.

            <p>
              When learning most programming languages the first thing people do
              is make the computer print &quot;Hello World!&quot;. For 3D, one
              of the most common first things to do is to make a 3D cube. So
              let's start with &quot;Hello Cube!&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we get started let's try to give you an idea of the
              structure of a 3D GUI app. This app requires you to create a bunch
              of objects and connect them together. Here's a diagram that
              represents a small 3D app.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                class="mx-auto d-block"
                src="img/3d-structure.png"
                alt="3D App Structure"
              />
            </p>
            <p>Things to notice about the diagram above:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is an <strong>Application</strong>. This is the main
                object of GUI App. You add widgets to an app and the
                <strong>View</strong> widget is used to render a 3D scene via a
                specified <strong>Camera</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a Scenegraph which is a tree like structure, consisting
                of various objects like a <strong>Background</strong>,
                <strong>Skybox</strong>, <strong>Meshes</strong>,
                <strong>Lights</strong> and <strong>Fog</strong>. A
                <strong>Scene</strong> object defines the root of the Scenegraph
                in which objects define a hierarchical parent/child tree like
                structure and represent where objects appear and how they are
                oriented. Children are positioned and oriented relative to their
                parent. For example the wheels on a car might be children of the
                car so that moving and orienting the car's object automatically
                moves the wheels.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mesh</strong> and <strong>Wireframe</strong> objects
                represent drawing a specific <strong>Geometry</strong> with a
                specific <strong>Material</strong>. Both
                <strong>Material</strong> objects and
                <strong>Geometry</strong> objects can be used by multiple
                <strong>Mesh</strong> objects. For example to draw two blue
                cubes in different locations we could need two
                <strong>Mesh</strong> objects to represent the position and
                orientation of each cube. We would only need one
                <strong>Geometry</strong> to hold the vertex data for a cube and
                we would only need one <strong>Material</strong> to specify the
                color blue. Both <strong>Mesh</strong> objects could reference
                the same <strong>Geometry</strong> object and the same
                <strong>Material</strong> object.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geometry</strong> objects represent the vertex data of
                some piece of geometry like a sphere, cube, plane, dog, cat,
                human, tree, building, etc... ObjectTalk provides many kinds of
                built in <strong>Geometry</strong> primitives. You can also
                create custom geometry as well as load geometry models from
                files.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Material</strong> objects represent the surface
                properties used to draw geometry including things like the color
                to use and how shiny it is. A <strong>Material</strong> can also
                reference a texture which can be used, for example, to wrap an
                image onto the surface of a geometry.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Light</strong> objects represent different kinds of
                lights.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Given all of that, we're going to make the smallest possible
              &quot;Hello Cube&quot; App that looks like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                class="mx-auto d-block"
                src="img/3d-hello-cube.png"
                alt="3D App Structure"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is a skeleton ObjectTalk GUI App that forms the basis for
              every application. You simply subclass the
              <strong>Application</strong> class, populate the
              <strong>setup</strong> member function and run the App.
            </p>
            <pre><code>var gui = import(&quot;gui&quot;);

class App : gui.App {
	function setup(this) {
	}
}

var app = App();
app.run();
</code></pre>
            <p>
              This is a complete and valid App even though it doesn't do
              anything. You can launch the App and it will create a black screen
              or black window depending on your operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
              So let's start to populate the <strong>setup</strong> member
              function and first create a <strong>Scene</strong>.
            </p>
            <pre><code>var ambient = gui.AmbientLight();

var geometry = gui.BoxGeometry();
var material = gui.ColoredMaterial(&quot;gold&quot;);

var cube = gui.Mesh(geometry, material);

var scene = gui.Scene()
	.add(ambient)
	.add(cube);
</code></pre>
            <p>
              Here we turn on the light (a simple ambient light source in this
              case) to ensure we can actusally see our creation. Then we create
              a <strong>BoxGeometry</strong> geometry followed by a
              <strong>Material</strong> instance. Please note that we are going
              for the gold here in our first App (this is not a low budget
              tutorial, is it). The <strong>Mesh</strong> uses the created
              geometry and material. Our simple <strong>Scene</strong> can now
              be created as it only has one member.
            </p>
            <p>Now let's create a <strong>Camera</strong>:</p>
            <pre><code>var camera = gui.Camera()
	.setPerspective(75, 0.1, 5)
	.setPosition(0, 0, 2);
</code></pre>
            <p>
              FOV is short for Field Of View. In this case 75 degrees. Note that
              most angles in ObjectTalk's GUI module are in radians but the
              camera takes degrees for FOV. Read up onOpenGL and other libraries
              and you see where this comes from. The clipping parameters express
              a near and far point. near and far represent the space in front of
              the camera that will be rendered. Anything before that range or
              after that range will be clipped (not drawn).
            </p>
            <p>
              Those settings define a &quot;frustum&quot;. A frustum is the name
              of a 3D shape that is like a pyramid with the tip sliced off. In
              other words, think of the word &quot;frustum&quot; as another 3D
              shape like sphere, cube, prism, frustum.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                class="mx-auto d-block"
                src="img/3d-frustum.png"
                alt="3D App Structure"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The camera defaults to looking down the -Z axis with +Y up. We'll
              put our cube at the origin so we need to move the camera back a
              little from the origin in order to see anything. This is what
              <strong>setPosition</strong> does. So here is what we are aiming
              for:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                class="mx-auto d-block"
                src="img/3d-scene-down.png"
                alt="3D App Structure"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              In the diagram above, we can see our camera is at z = 2. It's
              looking down the -Z axis. Our frustum starts 0.1 units from the
              front of the camera and goes to 5 units in front of the camera.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally we create the <strong>View</strong>, connect the
              <strong>Camera</strong>, connect the <strong>Scene</strong> and
              make it visible on the <strong>Screen</strong>:
            </p>
            <pre><code>var view = gui.View()
	.setCamera(camera)
	.setScene(scene);

screen.add(view);
</code></pre>
            <p>Our complete App now looks like this:</p>
            <pre><code>var gui = import(&quot;gui&quot;);

class App : gui.App {
	function setup(this) {
		var ambient = gui.AmbientLight();

		var geometry = gui.BoxGeometry();
		var material = gui.ColoredMaterial(&quot;gold&quot;);
		var cube = gui.Mesh(geometry, material);

		var scene = gui.Scene()
			.add(ambient)
			.add(cube);

		var camera = gui.Camera()
			.setPerspective(75, 0.1, 5)
			.setPosition(0, 0, 2);

		var view = gui.View()
			.setCamera(camera)
			.setScene(scene);

		this.add(view);
	}
}

var app = App();
app.run();
</code></pre>
            <p>
              Let's run this App and be amazed how underwhelming the result is.
              It looks like we drew just a square. Yes, It's kind of hard to
              tell that is a 3D cube since we're viewing it directly down the -Z
              axis and the cube itself is axis aligned so we're only seeing a
              single face.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's animate it spinning and hopefully that will make it clear
              it's being drawn in 3D. To animate it we'll add an animation to
              the App:
            </p>
            <pre><code>this.addAnimation(gui.Animation()
	.from(0.0)
	.to(pi * 2.0)
	.during(15000)
	.continuous()
	.onStep(function(angle) {
		cube.rotateAroundVector(angle, 1, 1, 0);
	}));
</code></pre>
            <p>
              This animation animates a real from 0.0 to 2PI during 15000
              microseconds (or 15 seconds) and repeats this endlessly. The
              number is than used to rotate the cube around the [0, 0, 0] vector
              which makes it spin around the X and Y axis.
            </p>
            <p>
              We now start to see that we have a cube but it is start hard to
              make out as all sides are colored the same way. The first thing we
              can do is change the <strong>Mesh</strong> 3D object to a
              <strong>Wireframe</strong>. This makes it clear that we truly have
              a cube.
            </p>
            <p>
              The better solution is to add light to make it more realistic. So
              far, our <strong>Scene</strong> only included a dim
              <strong>Ambient</strong> light so we could see our creations. You
              can also add directional <strong>Lights</strong> that make it
              easier to make the scene more realistic. So let's change the App
              to:
            </p>
            <pre><code>var gui = import(&quot;gui&quot;);

class App : gui.App {
	function setup(this) {
		var geometry = gui.BoxGeometry();
		var material = gui.ColoredMaterial(&quot;gold&quot;);
		var cube = gui.Mesh(geometry, material);

		this.addAnimation(gui.Animation()
			.from(0.0)
			.to(pi * 2.0)
			.during(15000)
			.continuous()
			.onStep(function(angle) {
				cube.rotateAroundVector(angle, 1, 1, 0);
			}));

		var ambient = gui.AmbientLight();
		var light = gui.DirectionalLight(-1, -2, -4);

		var scene = gui.Scene()
			.add(cube)
			.add(ambient)
			.add(light);

		var camera = gui.Camera()
			.setPerspective(75, 0.1, 5)
			.setPosition(0, 0, 2);

		var view = gui.View()
			.setCamera(camera)
			.setScene(scene);

		this.add(view);
	}
}

var app = App();
app.run();
</code></pre>
            <p>
              It should now be pretty clearly 3D. Directional lights have a
              direction as the name suggests In our case we're setting the
              light's direction to 1, 2, 4 so it's coming from the right, above,
              and behind our camera. A slightly more complex version with three
              rotating cubes can be found in the examples folder.

              ObjectTalk has a large number of primitives or geometries.
              Geometries are generally 3D shapes that are generated at runtime
              with a bunch of parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's common to use geometries for things like a sphere for a globe
              or a bunch of boxes to draw a 3D graph. It's especially common to
              use geometries to experiment and get started with 3D. For the
              majority of 3D apps it's more common to have an artist make 3D
              models in a 3D modeling program like Blender or Maya or Cinema 4D.
              These models can also be loaded in as geometries but later you
              will see that complex models can also be loaded complete with
              their own materials. For now let's go over some of the available
              geometries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the geometries below have defaults for some or all of
              their parameters so you can use more or less depending on your
              needs. For each geometry supported by ObjectTalk, a small test
              program is available in the examples folder
              (examples/3d/geometries). These little programs allow you to play
              with the parameters of a geometry so you can see the effect life.
