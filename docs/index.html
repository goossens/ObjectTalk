              Welcome to the documentation for ObjectTalk, a object-oriented
              Swiss Army Knife providing a Scripting Language, 2D/3D Graphics
              Engine, Node Based Programming, an Entity Component System and an
              Integrated Development Environment to learn and have some fun.
              Below is a quick introduction to the ObjectTalk eco system and you
              can get access to the details using the menubar at the top of this
              documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Full source code can be found in the
              <a href="https://github.com/goossens/ObjectTalk"
                >GitHub repository</a
              >. Instructions for building and installing ObjectTalk on various
              platforms can be found in the
              <a href="installation.html">installation manual</a>. Currently,
              instructions are available for MacOS, Linux and Windows.

              Late 2020, I retired after a 40+ year career in the software and
              system development business. Starting as a programmer/analyst and
              later moving up the ladder to management, international
              standardization and geopolitics, I was exposed to lots of
              technologies including operating system design, computer language
              development, military command and control systems, web application
              design, data science and what we now call artificial intelligence.
              You can read my full bio on
              <a href="https://goossens.github.io">my website</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              After retirement, I dusted off some old projects to improve mental
              health (applying the &quot;use it or loss it&quot; principle like
              we do for physical health) and that's how this repository came
              about. I started by revisiting a scripting language I wrote
              decades ago, modernizing it and learning things along the way.
              Once the language was stable, it needed a few use cases and I
              dusted off some 2D/3D graphic projects that I had laying around.
              This then led to including a graphics engine, an Entity Component
              System (ECS), Node Based programming and a custom Integrated
              Development Environment (IDE).
            </p>
            <p>
              So today, this project contains a lot of code, compiles into a
              single executable with no runtime dependencies and is functional
              on MacOS, Linux and Windows. It basically is a playground to learn
              and have fun. Think of it as a educational jack of all trades,
              master of none.

              ObjectTalk is a simple object-oriented scripting language that has
              evolved over decades and was heavily influenced by other
              languages. As a long time IT professional, I've seen a lot of
              software development with all its greatness and flaws. ObjectTalk
              represents what I think is a well-balanced scripting language that
              is easy to learn and can make even a novice look good quickly. If
              you are interested in how I got to where we are today, please see
              the <a href="tour.html#history">history</a> page for the story
              behind ObjectTalk.

            <p>
              ObjectTalk contains a pretty decent 2D/3D graphics engine that
              works across multiple platforms providing system agnostic
              abstractions for the higher level capabilities. At its core, the
              graphics engine manages graphical resources (e.g. shaders,
              buffers, uniforms, textures and other assets) and is
              multithreaded. It also contains cross platform libraries to
              implement canvases, filters, generators, vector displays, font
              management, asynchronous asset loading in a variety of formats,
              2D/3D geometric primitives, manifold definitions and 2D path
              manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of its capabilities are already exposed to the scripting
              language and the examples folder shows how to use it to create
              simple GUIs, run some games in a vintage vector display or
              implement a simple version of Pac-Man.

            <p>
              Many years ago, I developed a graphical node-based editor to
              configure computer I/O systems complete with stream processing and
              protocol conversion. This worked really well and it allowed
              non-programmers to assist during development, maintenance and
              operations. Once I played with Blender's nodes for geometry and
              shaders, I thought it was a good idea to also add nodes to
              ObjectTalk. Please keep in mind though that becoming a Blender
              clone is not one of the ambitions of this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each node really feels like an object instance and drawing
              connections between them is akin to visual programming. Today, in
              ObjectTalk, the IDE has an node editor that allows you to setup
              nodes and connect them into a graph. These graphs are
              automatically reevaluated when values change. The examples folder
              contains image processing chains and nodes are used in the scene
              examples to process images or create geometry. ObjectTalk already
              has over 50 nodes already and many will follow depending on my
              needs.
            </p>

          <div id="scenes">
            <h1 class="pb-2">Scenes</h1>
            <p>
              My older 3D graphics projects were always based on OpenGL as at
              the time, it felt like a good cross-platform solution and a
              standard that most operating system providers would implement.
              Fast forwarding a few years and we now have a number of graphics
              APIs like DirectX, Vulkan and Metal with programmable shaders and
              all of them are different. So in the end, I decided that my
              graphics engine mentioned above will provide an abstraction over
              all of these APIs (in fact, the graphics engine uses DirectX on
              Windows, Vulkan on Linux and Metal on MacOS) and focus the 3D
              scene capability at a higher level.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is where the Entity Component System (ECS) comes in as an
              architectural pattern that has already been used in games for many
              years. ObjectTalk's IDE contains an ECS editor that allows you to
              define entities (objects in the real world) and associate a
              variety of components with them that offer functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 3D scene ECS also has nodes and script components to make the
              whole thing more dynamic. In the examples folder, you'll find
              automatically spinning cubes based on timers and an earth rotating
              based on mouse movements. Both of these a driven by script
              components. The jungle and island examples use nodes to
              procedurally create terrain and asset instances.
            </p>
            <p>
              To round it all out, modern engine features like geometry/model
              importing, support for animation, deferred rendering, Physically
              Based Rendering (PBR), particle systems, Image Based Lighting
              (IBL), Cascaded Shadow Maps (CSMs) and post processing with Fog,
              Bloom, God Rays, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA),
              Exposure/Contrast correction and Tone Mapping are also available.

              To round it all out, the ObjectTalk executable comes with a
              builtin Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows
              editing and execution of the ObjectTalk elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>ObjectTalk script editor</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This editor provides a powerful syntax highlighting
                    capability modeled after a subset of Visual Studio Code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The editor has full undo capabilities and works with UTF-8
                    encoded text.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The editor can launch ObjectTalk scripts and has a console
                    for output and highlighting for errors.
                  </li>
                  <li>A visual debugger is also available.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Node editor</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This editor allows the visual creation of node graphs.
                  </li>
                  <li>The editor has full undo capabilities.</li>
                  <li>
                    The editor automatically evaluates graphs so it can be used
