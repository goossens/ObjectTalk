            <h1 class="pb-2">Nodes Overview</h1>
            <p>
              Node-based programming is a visual approach to programming that
              uses interconnected nodes to represent different actions and data
              flows. These nodes are essentially &quot;blocks&quot; of code that
              perform specific tasks and they are linked together to create
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"
                >Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a
              >, where data flows from one node to another.
            </p>
            <p><img src="img/nodes.png#center" alt="Nodes" /></p>
            <p>
              A node represents a small function that transforms inputs into
              outputs, optionally using additional parameters. In ObjectTalk,
              nodes are visually represented by rounded rectangles displaying a
              title at the top, inputs displayed on the left and outputs on the
              rights. Inputs and outputs are referred to as pins that can be
              connected and can carry only one datatype.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each node really feels like an object instance and drawing
              connections between them is akin to visual programming. Today, in
              ObjectTalk, the IDE has an node editor that allows you to setup
              nodes and connect them into a graph. These graphs are
              automatically reevaluated when values change or connections are
              made/removed. The examples folder contains image processing chains
              and nodes are used in the scene examples to process images or
              create geometry. ObjectTalk already has over 90 nodes already and
              many will follow depending on my needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can draw connections between nodes (called links) and the
              editor ensures that output and input nodes have compatible data
              types, that inputs have a maximum of one connection and that the
              created graph does not include recursion (i.e stays acyclic). As
              links are created/moved/deleted or values altered, the editor
              automatically (re-)evaluates the graphs given the user a realtime
              programming experience.
            </p>

          <div id="node-anatomy">
            <h1 class="pb-2">Node Anatomy</h1>

            <p>
              A node is depicted as a rounded rectangle with a title bar at the
              top, optional inputs on the left, optional outputs on the right
              and optional parameters in the middle of the rectangle.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Title Bar</strong></p>
            <p>
              At the top of the node is a title bar which by default contains
              the name of the node. By double clicking on the title, users can
              name a node anything they want to better express its function in a
              graph. The background of the title bar is color coded to represent
              the category of the node (see Node Categories below).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Input Pins</strong></p>
            <p>
              Optional inputs to a node are represented on the left side of that
              node by what's called pins. Each pin represents an input with a
              specified type that is color coded (see Pin Types below). Input
              pins can only receive data from one output pin. and the pin data
              types have to match (which is enforced by the IDE).
            </p>
            <p>
              If an input pin is not connected and the data types allows easy
              specification by the user, a field will be visible to the right of
              the pin's name to allow the user to specify a static value.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Output Pins</strong></p>
            <p>
              Optional output from a node are represented on the right side of
              the node by pins. Each pin represents an output with a specified
              type that is color coded (see pin types below). Output pins can be
              connected to multiple input pins as long as the data types match
              (also enforced by th IDE).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Node Parameters</strong></p>
            <p>
              Some nodes also might have additional parameters or visualizations
              to help the node perform its function. The node parameters are
              rendered in the middle of the node.
            </p>

          <div id="node-categories">
            <h1 class="pb-2">Node Categories</h1>
            <p>
              Nodes are grouped in categories that make it easier to find them
              and recognize them in a graph. Each category has a unique color as
              shown on the right below.
            </p>
            <p><img src="img/node-categories.png#right" alt="screenshot" /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Input Nodes</strong> - These nodes enable users to input
                values or select assets (e.g. images, textures, geometries). If
                a nodes graph is used in another object (e.g. a 3D scene), input
                fields enable users to interact with the graph's functionality
                without having the understand the full logic. This in essence
                makes a nodes graph a macro or sub-function somewhere else.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Field Nodes</strong> - These nodes provides values in
                the context of a graph and are only useful if there is a node
                upstream that operates on multiple values. See section below on
                variable data flows.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Math Nodes</strong> - These nodes perform mathematical
                operations on primitive (integer, real) and composite (vector)
                values.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Probe Nodes</strong> - These nodes provide debugging
                support by visualizing various data types.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Save Nodes</strong> - These nodes enable the user to
                save various data types to specified files.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Virtualize Nodes</strong> - These nodes save data to the
                internal virtual (memory-based) file system. This allows assets
                to be created or transformed dynamically with nodes and then be
                used in for instance 3D scenes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Image Nodes</strong> - These nodes create, process,
                filter or transform images. In ObjectTalk, images are pictures
                that live on the CPU.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Texture Nodes</strong> - These nodes create, process,
                filter or transform textures. In ObjectTalk, textures are
                pictures that live on the GPU. In general, texture nodes are
                faster than image nodes as all processing is GPU accelerated.
                Nodes are available to convert between images and textures.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shape Nodes</strong> - These nodes generate, process or
                convert 2D vector shapes that are created with one or more
                paths.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geometry Nodes</strong> - These nodes generate,
                manipulate and convert geometries which consist of one or more
                3D meshes. In ObjectTalk, a geometry is a 3D object made up of
                meshes which are a collection of interconnected triangles
                (faces). These triangles are formed by connecting vertices
                (points) with straight edges. The mesh defines the surface of
                the 3D object, but not its interior volume.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Manifold Nodes</strong> - These nodes operate on
                manifolds. In ObjectTalk, manifolds are specializations of
                geometries. A manifold mesh is watertight and contains no holes
                or missing faces that would cause leaks into the interior of the
                shape's volume. For a mesh to be manifold, every edge must have
                exactly two adjacent faces. Geometries do not have this
                constraint. Manifolds are often used in CAD applications to
                create 3D models through Constructive Solid Geometry. You can
                combined or subtract solid shapes, transform them, extrude them
                from 2D shapes or slice 3D models back into 2D shapes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Map Nodes</strong> - These nodes work on geospatial data
                (either real or fictitious).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div id="pin-types">
            <h1 class="pb-2">Pin Types</h1>
            <p>
              The input and output pins of a node can only carry one specific
              data type. Each of these types is color coded and the IDE ensures
              links are only created using compatible types. Below are all the
              data types used by pins:
            </p>
            <p><img src="img/pin-types.png#right" alt="screenshot" /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Boolean Pins</strong> - Booleans can only hold two
                values: true and false.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Integer Pins</strong> - Integers represent negative and
                positive whole numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Float Pins</strong> - Floats are double-precision
                floating point numbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>String Pins</strong> - Strings are sequences of UTF-8
                encoded characters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>VectorX Pins</strong> - Vectors (2D, 3D or 4D) represent
                a quantity with both magnitude and direction expressed as
                coordinates along the dimensional axis.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Color Pins</strong> - Colors are represented by their
                RGBA values.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Font Pins</strong> - Fonts are a set of printed letters,
                numbers, and other symbols of the same style.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Image Pins</strong> - Images are a visual representation
                of something (a picture) that lives on the CPU.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Texture Pins</strong> - Textures are a visual
                representation of something (a picture) that lives on the GPU.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shape Pins</strong> - Shapes define the outline or shape
                of an object using one or more paths.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geometry Pins</strong> - Geometries are three
                dimensional objects consisting of triangular faces that connect
                vertices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Manifold Pins</strong> - Manifolds are specializations
                of geometries. A manifold mesh is watertight and contains no
                holes or missing faces that would cause leaks into the interior
                of the shape's volume. For a mesh to be manifold, every edge
                must have exactly two adjacent faces. Geometries do not have
                this constraint.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Map Pins</strong> - Maps describe geospatial geometries
                (either real or fictitious) including properties of the faces
                (e.g. biome type).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Instances Pins</strong> -Instances describe the
                transforms applied to a numbers of 3D geometry instances.

            <p>
              In ObjectTalk, nodes can support different data flows. Most nodes
              process &quot;fixed&quot; flows that act as simple functions
              taking the provided inputs (with optional node parameters), apply
              a one time algorithm and produce outputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some nodes (e.g. Instances on Faces) run the algorithm on each
              element of the input (e.g. faces in a geometry). Those nodes
              create a context and evaluate each input once per element. If a
              downstream input node is a &quot;varying&quot; node, the context
              is accessed and the correct value provided. This allows processing
              of composite data (e.g. geometries) by evaluating each element
              (e.g. vertex or face).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some nodes are chameleons (e.g. math nodes) and they can operate
              on &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;varying&quot; flows. The nodes are
              considered &quot;flexible&quot;. The node reference documentation
              highlights whether a node is considered &quot;fixed&quot;,
              &quot;varying&quot; or &quot;flexible&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              Input and output pins visualize their mode by drawing a circle in
              &quot;fixed&quot; mode and a diamond in &quot;varying&quot; mode .
              Link are drawn with a solid line for &quot;fixed&quot; connections
              and with dashed lines for &quot;varying&quot; connections.
