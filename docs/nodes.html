            <p>
              ObjectTalk is a simple object-oriented scripting language that has
              evolved over decades and was heavily influenced by other
              languages. As a long time IT professional, I've seen a lot of
              software development with all its greatness and flaws. ObjectTalk
              represents what I think is a well-balanced scripting language that
              is easy to learn and can make even a novice look good quickly. If
              you are interested in how I got to where we are today, please see
              the <a class="page-scroll" href="#history">history</a> section
              below for the story behind ObjectTalk.
            </p>
            <p>
              So before continuing, let me address the elephant in the room. Why
              the heck would the world need another scripting language? Well,
              the simple answer is: it doesn't!! We already have more than
              enough of them. I wouldn't even suggest ObjectTalk is a language
              for serious software development. If you need to deploy mission
              critical code, look elsewhere. ObjectTalk is however a good
              starting point to learn programming and it's also good if you want
              to learn language development. Those of you who have ever looked
              at the code for compilers and interpreters for populars languages
              will probably know what I mean.
            </p>
            <p>The objectives for the development of ObjectTalk are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn computer language development.</li>
              <li>
                Learn how to write a lexical scanner and language compiler.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learn how to implement a simple stack-based virtual machine.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learn how to develop a language that is:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fully object-oriented.</li>
                  <li>Dynamically typed.</li>
                  <li>Lexically scoped.</li>
                  <li>Closure/capture aware.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Learn C++17 as that is the language the ObjectTalk engine is
                written in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Keep the code multi-platform to support reuse and maximum
                outreach.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don't over-optimize to keep the code readable (so others can
                learn).
              </li>
              <li>End up with something that can be used for simple tasks.</li>
              <li>
                Have enough capability to create simple applications like:
                <ul>
                  <li>Web servers based on a few lines of code.</li>
                  <li>
                    Cool looking desktop applications including 2D/3D games.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Have fun.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So I believe (and yes, I might be a little biased), that
              ObjectTalk is meeting the objectives above and will provide others
              the ability to learn from this as well. If you agree with me, feel
              free to reuse and contribute. Collective learning is a great
              thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              So what's good about ObjectTalk? Well, typically it is a very
              personal as to what is good or bad about a computer language. Many
              religious wars have been waged over the years when it comes to
              good and bad in Computerland. Those that have strong opinions
              about computer languages will have the same views about
              ObjectTalk. I'm wide open to ObjectTalk improvements but they'll
              have to be within the context of the objectives above.
              Constructive advice is very welcome. Bullies, meanies and
              know-it-alls will be ignored and are advised to develop their own
              language.
            </p>
            <p>So what makes ObjectTalk great (at least in my little mind)?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's easy to learn (simple yet consistent grammar and no
                &quot;over-the-top, you'll-never-use-it but
                look-at-how-smart-I-am language creep&quot;).
              </li>
              <li>
                It is truly object-oriented as everything is an object (even
                numbers, strings and functions) with members and member
                functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The language will feel comfortable to everyone who has worked on
                C-derived languages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Variables are dynamically typed and primitive objects like
                Booleans, Integers, Reals and Strings are automatically
                converted when required.
              </li>
              <li>
                Functions are first class citizens and can be passed as
                arguments or bound to an object as member functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Variables are lexically scoped and must be declared before use.
              </li>
              <li>
                Variables are automatically captured in closures if required.
              </li>
              <li>Variables are always initialized before use.</li>
              <li>Memory is managed automatically.</li>
              <li>A single pass compiler generates simple bytecode.</li>
              <li>A simple optimizer improves the generated bytecode.</li>
              <li>
                A simple stack-based Virtual Machine (VM) executes the bytecode.
              </li>
            </ul>
