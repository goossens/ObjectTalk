# Pac-Man

This is an implementation of the classic Pac-Man game. It does not implement all the features
nor does it completely mimic the original. It does however show the graphical abilities
of ObjectTalk using a Canvas object as well as the ability to implement game logic in an
object-oriented scripting language.

For a more complete implementation, please see [this version](https://github.com/masonicGIT/pacman)
which was used as an inspiration for this ObjectTalk exemple. It's implemented in JavaScript and
uses the HTML Canvas which made it a good role model.

For an explanation of Pac-Man the arcade game as well as its history, please see the excellent
[Pac-Man Dossier](https://pacman.holenet.info) by Jamey Pittman.
