Compute Pipelines:
	set 0: Read-Only storage textures and buffers
	set 1: Read-Write storage textures and buffers
	set 2: Uniform buffers

Graphics Pipelines:
	set 0: Samplers, textures and storage buffers available to the vertex shader
	set 1: Uniform buffers available to the vertex shader
	set 2: Samplers, textures and storage buffers available to the fragment shader
	set 3: Uniform buffers available to the fragment shader

Coordinate System:
	Normalized Device Coordinates: The lower-left corner has an x,y coordinate of (-1.0, -1.0).
	The upper-right corner is (1.0, 1.0). Z values range from [0.0, 1.0] where 0 is the near plane.

	Viewport Coordinates: The top-left corner has an x,y coordinate of (0, 0) and
	extends to the bottom-right corner at (viewportWidth, viewportHeight). +Y is down.

	Texture Coordinates: The top-left corner has an x,y coordinate of (0, 0) and
	extends to the bottom-right corner at (1.0, 1.0). +Y is down.
